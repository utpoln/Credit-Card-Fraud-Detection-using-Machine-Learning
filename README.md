# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Model for Detecting Credit Card Fraud in Anonymized Transactions

Credit card companies need robust fraud detection models to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions, ensuring that customers are not billed for purchases they didn't make. The dataset comprises credit card transactions conducted by European cardholders in September 2013. This dataset covers transactions over two days, with 492 identified as fraudulent out of a total of 284,807 transactions. Notably, the dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions making up just 0.172% of all recorded transactions.
